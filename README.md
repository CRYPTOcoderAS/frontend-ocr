I have made ocr using google vision api 
Tech stack - Mongodb ExpressJs ReactJs Nodejs 
I have deployed my frontend using github pages and backend using render 
I set this repo in local system one should extract the code from github for frontend and run npm install and then npm start
then for backend use  npm install and npm run server
